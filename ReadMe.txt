Setting Up For Cumulus Users
============================
Some brief notes for Cumulus users (but other users should skim this as well):

Copy "weather_server\cumulus\realtimegaugesT.txt" to your Cumulus\web folder.
Copy "weather_server\cumulus\gauges-ssT.htm" to your Cumulus\web folder.

Configure Cumulus Internet|Files to:
 realtime file:-
    Local filename = <path>\Cumulus\web\realtimegaugesT.txt
    Remote filename = <website_root_path>/realtimegauges.txt
    Process = Yes
    Realtime = Yes
    FTP = Yes (unless you are local hosting)
 gauges HTML file:-
    Local filename = <path>\Cumulus\web\gauges-ssT.htm
    Remote filename = <website_root_path>/gauges-ss.htm
    Process = Yes
    Realtime = No
    FTP = Yes (unless you are local hosing)

NOTE: Cumulus does not actually update any data when it processes the web
      page, it simply replaces the 'static-ish' values such as your station
      name, location, version etc. If you wish you can edit the .htm file and
      directly enter the information, then you do not need to get Cumulus to
      process the file, just copy it once to your web site, removing the 'T'
      from the file name.

If required edit the "gauges.js", the key items are at the top:
    The relative path on your website to the "realtimegauges.txt" file.
    The relative path on your website to your 'trend' graphs folder.
    The relative path on your website to your old 'gauges' page.
      - users with 'old' browsers will be redirected to this page.
    If you do not require the UV/Solar Index gauges, then change the lines
      showUvGauge       : true,
      showSolarGauge    : true,
    to
      showUvGauge       : false,
      showSolarGauge    : false,


If you have installed to a web folder different from your Cumulus 'root' you
will also need to edit the "gauges-ss.htm" file, and amend the relative path
to your Cumulus "weatherstyle.css" file.

Relative Paths :
  Are just that, they specify where something is on your web site folder
  structure relative to the page you are currently displaying.
  So if you copy these gauges to a folder called 'gauges-ss' in the root of
  your website, the relative path of the Cumulus css file is one folder back in the
  path. You would then enter the path as "../weatherstyle.css".

Copy (or move) the folders 'web_server\css' and 'web_server\scripts' and their contents (the
files that are contained in the ZIP file) to the folder where your "gauges-ss.htm" file is
located (probably the same folder where all your other Cumulus HTM files are located).


What Next?
----------
After you get your new gauges page up and running, you will probably want to make it the
default gauges page on your web site. So assuming you are running the 'standard' Cumulus
web pages (if not then you can figure all this stuff out for yourself), you will need to
edit all the Cumulus supplied template files.

These files reside in your "<path_to_cumulus>\cumulus\web" folder. You will need to edit
each xxxxxT.htm file, and near the bottom change the link from "gauges.htm" to "gauges-ss.htm"
(also include the path if you have installed the SS gauges into a sub-folder from you main
Cumulus web site).

Next time Cumulus updates your web site, the links on all your existing pages should now
point to the new SS gauges.

It is as well to leave the original Cumulus gauges page on your site, the new page will direct
any really old incompatible browsers back to the original page.

If you decide on a different 'standard' gauge size, then you need to edit the gauges-ss.css
file. By default all the gauges use the ".gaugeSizeStd" class, simply change the width and height
settings there.

You can also remove any HTML elements associated  with gauges you will not use as well, again
this is not mandatory, the script will remove them dynamically for you.

Browser Redirects
-----------------

If you want to redirect browsers that do not have scripting enabled, then you will have to
do this in the HTML file itself. In the header section add the following code:
  <noscript>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3; url=index.htm"/>
  </noscript>
Obviously with the url changed to where ever you want redirect pointing.


Changing Languages
------------------

To switch statically, you need to edit the "gauges.js" file, and change the line 12
  var strings = LANG.EN,
to
  var strings = LANG.XX,
 (where XX is the desired language code).

To add a new translation, edit the "language.js" file and copy one of the existing sections
e.g. English, to the end of the file, changing all the LANG.EN values to LANG.XX (where XX is
the code for the new language), and editing all the strings. The zip file contains a
language.js file with English, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Italian,
Spanish, and Catalan translations to get you going.

If you are only going to use one language, then deleting the unused language options and the
changeLang() function from the language.js file will speed up the page load time slightly.

To switch languages dynamically, you need to add script code to your page which sets the LANG
object to equal the desired language then call the changeLang() function.
e.g.
    // Dynamic script to change the default language to German
    changeLang(LANG.DE);

This will re-label all the gauges, and update the text/radio buttons etc on the web page.

However, changing the language for the gauges DOES NOT translate the displayed forecast
as the text of the message is being supplied by your weather station/software.

NOTE: If your forecast messages use accented characters (or any character not in the basic 103
characters in the LCD font), then I recommend that you disable the digital font on the status/forecast
display. Set the following in gauges.js:

    digitalForecast       : false,

Weather Display users have different options for the forecast message to be used. By default the
ccrlocal file uses the Davis VP %vpforecasttext% tag. Change this to what suits you best:

    %vpforecasttext%            Davis VP forecast
    %forecasticonword%          Words for the (Davis?) forecast icon
    %dailywarning/forecast%     forecast from input daily weather




Adding Logo's/Custom Images to the Gauge Backgrounds
----------------------------------------------------
The supplied code contains some commented out instructions to add a small logo to the temperature
gauge, and a larger image to the DewPoint gauge. These will probably be removed by most people,
they are added to demonstrate how to use this feature. See the comments in gauges.js about
removing/adding these logos.

In order to let the gauge background appear through your images you should make them
semi-transparent, which means saving them as PNG files.

The SteelSeries code will clip your images if they exceed the gauge background area, I suggest you
size the images similar to your desired gauge size. The code will resize the image to fit the
whole background, so it you want to retain the aspect ratio make your images square!

Forecast Messages
-----------------
By default for Cumulus the <#forecastenc> message is displayed which shows either the Cumulus
generated forecast or the external station generated forecast depending on how Cumulus is configured.
Starting with version 1.9.2 Cumulus has additional forecast message options:
<#cumulusforecastenc> - Always displays the Cumulus generated Zambretti forecast
<#wsforecastenc> - Always displays the external weather station forecast

If you wish to use one of these options, then you should edit the "realtimegaugesT.txt" file
and replace the '<#forecastenc>' tag with the one of your choice.

You can of course opt not to display the forecast at all, but display any data available from
your weather programs 'tags'.


Removing a Wind Rose and Other Optional Gauges
----------------------------------------------
From release 2.0 I have integrated the Wind Rose 'gauge' into the standard 'package', from v2.1.0 it is enabled
by default. From version 2.5.0 there is also an optional Cloud Base gauge, again enabled by default.
To disable the Wind Rose you have to make the following changes...

1. Edit gauges-ssT.htm/gauges-ss-basic.htm/gauges-ss-basic-inc.php and delete the 'radar' scripts
towards the end of the document.
       <script src="scripts/RGraph.common.core.min.js"></script>
       <script src="scripts/RGraph.rose.min.js"></script>

2. Edit gauges.js, and change...
     showRoseGauge     : true,
   To...
     showRoseGauge     : false,

That's it, the Wind Rose should now be removed from your page.
Note for VWS users the Wind Rose will be automatically disabled, but these users should still remove the
scripts from the HTML as above to reduce the page load times.

To disable the other optional gauges, just edit gauges.js and change the following entries to 'false'...
            showCloudGauge    : true,
            showUvGauge       : true,
            showSolarGauge    : true,


Altering the gauge 'layout' on the page
---------------------------------------
It is easy to 'move' the gauges around the page to create alternative layouts. By default, there are
four rows of gauges laid out like this (letter = optional gauge)...

  * * *
  * * r     r: Wind Rose
  * * *
  u s c     u: UV-I, s: Solar, c: Cloudbase

To move the gauges you just need to edit the HTML file and move <div>'s (and their contents) with a
class="gauge". Each 'row' is contained within a <div> with a class="row". If you do re-order the
gauges, then DO NOT change the "tip_N" numbers, each number is associated with a particular gauge not
it's position on the page.



Altering the gauge sizes on the page
------------------------------------

From version 2.2.0 the sizes of the gauges is controlled via CSS and longer coded in the gauges.js
script. By default all the gauge canvas tags are set to pick up their size from the ".gaugeSizeStd"
class in gauges-ss.css file. To change the size of all the gauges, simply edit this class and set the
width & height to your required size - the width and height should always be the same.

You can easily have different sized gauges on the same page, in the gauges-ss.css I have created two
additional classes ".gaugeSizeSml" and ".gaugeSizeLrg", (again you can edit the width/height values
of these classes to whatever you want), to assign one of these alternative sizes to a gauge, edit
the HTML and change (for example)...

      <canvas id="canvas_baro" class="gaugeSizeStd"></canvas>
      to
      <canvas id="canvas_baro" class="gaugeSizeLrg"></canvas>

This would change the Barometer from a 221 pixel gauge, to 261 pixels (using the default values).


Weather Display Users
=====================
  These files will work with WD if you switch the following value in gauges.js:
      weatherProgram    : 0,
    To...
      weatherProgram    : 1,

  This will make the script use the WD customclientraw.json file rather than the Cumulus realtimegauges.json file.
  A template for this file suitable for processing by WD is provided in the zip file - weather_server/weather_display/customclientrawlocal.txt

  To process the customclientrawlocal.txt, in WD you need to:
  * in control panel, webfiles/web page setup, real time ftp setup
  * see the custom client raw file setup...and tick to create that
  * make sure the needed customclientrawlocal.txt is in the clientraw folder location

  For Weather Display you should use the provided HTML files gauges-ss-basic.htm, or gauges-ss-basic-inc.php. The file
  gauges-ssT.htm is designed to be 'processed' by Cumulus before uploading to the web site.


  customclientrawlocal.txt
  ------------------------
  The value for Humidex is set to Celsius by default. You may want to change this
  tag from %humidexcelsius% to %humidexfaren% if you use Fahrenheit as your temperature
  scale. (there is no WD tag to report the value in your default scale).

  The value for Cloudbase is set to metres by default. You may want to change this tag
  from %cloudheightmeters% to %cloudheightfeet%, remember to also change the value for
  "cloudbaseunit":"m" to "cloudbaseunit":"ft"

  These and the forecast tag (see above)
  are the only things you should have to edit in the ccr file.



Virtual Weather Station (VWS) Users
===================================
  These files will work with VWS if you have set-up VWS to upload the WeatherFlash conditions files
  (wflash.txt, wflash2.txt).  You do not have to purchase WeatherFlash to use these scripts, but
  just have to set up VWS to upload the files via HTTP or FTP methods.  See VWS, Internet, WeatherFlash
  dialog for setup and use either Server File or Active Server Page to perform the upload with
  an interval of 10 seconds or so.

  steelseriesVWSjson.php
  ----------------------
  Configure the steelseriesVWSjson.php file settings area near the top of the file for the
  location of the WeatherFlash Data/ directory (using relative file addressing), and for your
  other preferences (units, time zone, etc.).

  In scripts/gauges.js,
  * change the weatherProgram variable to 2 to indicate VWS is being used.
  * change the imgPathURL to the relative URL location of the VWS vwsNNN.jpg graphs.
  * change the realTimeURL_VWS to the relative URL path of the steelseriesVWSjson.php script

  In gauges-ss-basic.htm,
  * remove the wind rose scripts by deleting the following lines...
         <script src="scripts/RGraph.common.core.min.js"></script>
         <script src="scripts/RGraph.rose.min.js"></script>

  Note that VWS does *not* produce data for all the entries to be displayed.
  The following are missing due to this lack of VWS supplied data:
  * wind rose display: the display will be disabled by default.
  * rain chart: the time of last rain is 'n/a'.
  * all-time min/max barometer pressure: the Barometer gauge will not show red areas up to
    the all record low pressure and from the record high pressure to the max of the gauge.
  * some gauges show only current values as the min/max values are not computed by VWS.
  * the humidex number is not provided by VWS, but computed by the steelseriesVWSjson.php script instead,
    so there is no humidex graph available.

  (Thanks to Ken True of saratoga-weather.org for the VWS support script)



WeatherCat Users
================

  Please see the WeatherCat wiki page for instructions: http://wiki.trixology.com/index.php/Steel_Series_Gauges




Meteobridge Users
=================

  Some features of the gauges page are not available, when you configure the program type to "4" the
  script automatically disables the Wind Rose gauge and the pop-up graphs.

  (Thanks to Ken True of saratoga-weather.org for the Meteobridge support script)




WView Users
===========

  In order to use the wind rose features, you may need to tweak your installation to produce the required
  data. The supplied file uses the tag <!--dayWindRoseList-->. Please see this thread...
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/wview/Yxdy5IS0R6U/RhFv4eUBd-MJ



WeeWX Users
===========

  Please refer to the separate readme.txt in the weather_server\WeeWX folder.



What is 'Long Polling'
======================

  HTTP long polling is a technique for only downloading data from the server when it is updated. An outline
  of the process is below, because it requires action on the web servers part, it requires something like PHP
  to be running on the web server.

    1. The client requests the webpage from the server using regular http.
    2. The webpage executes javascript which requests the realtime from the server.
    3. The server does not immediately respond with the requested file but waits until the file is updated.
    4. When there is new data available, the server responds with the new file.
    5. The client receives the new data and immediately sends another request to the server, re-starting the process at step 3.

  Configuring Long Polling
  ------------------------

  Standard long polling is only available for those web sites running PHP. The steps involved are:

    1. First establish the web site using the standard realtime text file for your weather software.
    2. Edit the long polling PHP file 'realtimegauges-longpoll.php', and set the name and path of your realtime file on the web server:
          $RealtimeFilename = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/realtimegauges.txt';
    3. Upload the long polling PHP file 'realtimegauges-longpoll.php' to your web server.
    4. Edit the gauges.js script on your web server, and enable long polling:
            config = {
                ...
                longPoll          : true,                  // if enabled, use long polling and PHP generated data !!only enable if you understand how this is implemented!!

       Then set the path to the long polling PHP file:
                ...
                realTimeURL_LongPoll: './utils/realtimegauges-longpoll.php',     //*** ALL Users: Change to your location of the PHP long poll realtime file ***

       Check that the realtime update interval is set correctly to your realtime interval:
                ...
                realtimeInterval  : 5,                      //*** Download data interval, set to your realtime data update interval in seconds

  Test it out, it should download the JSON data when the page loads, then every time the file is updated on the server.
  It is important that you also correctly configure the realtim upload interval, as this is used to determine if the next
  download request should be queued immediately or delayed a while. PHP by default has a maximum 30 second runtime for
  scripts, so we do not want to wait for a response longer than that - the script sets the max wait time to 20 seconds.




Cloud Base Gauge
===================

The cloud base gauge performs some rounding of the displayed values to prevent the display bouncing around too much.

If the display is in metres, then values below 1000 m are rounded to 10 m, above 1000 m, they are rounded to 50 m.
If the display is in feet, then values below 2000 ft are rounded to 50 ft, above 2000 ft, they are rounded to 100 ft.
